### Built-in Support For:

-   Bootstrap 5.x, FontAwesome 5.x
-   SASS Compilation
-   CSS AutoPrefixer
-   JS Babel Transpilation (ES6 Presets)
-   Webpack 5 Script Bundling
-   Assets Minification (CSS, JS, Images)
-   Image Optimizer (JPEG, GIF, PNG and SVGs)
-   CSS Sprite Images
-   BrowserSync for a no-lag browser reload
-   Gulp Workflow

### Salient Features

-   All your source files will reside inside 'src' folder.
-   Write SCSS with 7-in-1 SASS Architecture Folder Structure (src/scss)
-   Option to transpile JS via Babel. Create individual JS files for each of your JS function inside 'src/js/scripts' folder and they all will be concatenated on the top of each other, creating a scripts.js file inside 'assets/js' folder.
-   Use WebPack instead, to write Node or ES6 module based JS and bundle it as scripts.bundle.js.
-   Create CSS Sprites by dumping all your individual images/icons inside 'src/sprites' folder. It will generate a sprite of these images and place a corresponding \_sprites.scss file inside 'src/scss/components' folder to use the sprites via CSS classes.
-   Generate a production distributable copy of your application via gulp build.
-   Generate a development distribution copy of your application via gulp devbuild.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installtion

    <td>String</td>
    <td>webpack | concat</td>
    <td>Controls how your theme's custom JavaScript files will be compiled.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

There are more options that can be tweaked inside gulpconfig.json feel free to check them out.

<br>

### MODE

Manage the development or production mode of your theme.

```
{
    MODE: String ("development|production")
}
```

### COMPRESSION

Enable or disable this setting to enable compression for your CSS & JS files.

```
{
    COMPRESSION: BOOLEAN (true|false)
}
```

### JSBUILD

Controls how your theme's custom JavaScript files will be compiled.

```
{
    JUSBUILD: String ("concat|webpack")
}
```

-   "webpack" lets you use ES6 modules style building with webpack. You can edit your webpack configuration using gulpfile.js/webpack.config.js file. Create all your custom modules in the modules directory found at src/js/modules and use them in src/js/scripts.bundle.js file. Output file name will be scripts.bundle.min.js.
-   With "concat" option all your scripts inside src/js/scripts directory will be concated with the src/js/scripts.js file. Output file name will be scripts.js.

<br>

## Work with ES6 / Node Modules via Webpack

Use available node modules via npm while writing your scripts using webpack.

You can create your custom modules inside src/js/modules and use them in src/js/scripts.bundle.js file. Make sure to set JSBUILD to webpack inside your gulpfile.config.js file.

`{ JUSBUILD: "webpack" } `

Manage your webpack configration via webpack.config.js inside gulpfile.js folder.

<br>

## Work with unbundled/plain JS with Babel Support

-   Create your individual JS functions files inside src/js/scripts folder.
-   You can these functions inside src/js/scripts.js file.
-   All the \*.js files inside src/js/scripts folder will be concatenated on the top of each other and finally concatenated with src/js/scripts.js file.
-   Concatenated file will then be transpiled by babel and placed inside assets/js/scripts.js.

Manage your babel config by editing babel.config.json file in the root of your application.
